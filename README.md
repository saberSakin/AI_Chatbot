# AI_Chatbot

This is a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) Q&A system using the `llama-index` library and the **Meta LLaMA 3-8B Instruct model** from Hugging Face. It loads and indexes documents, retrieves relevant information based on user input, and generates responses. The system detects the language of the input (English or Bengali), processes it accordingly, and provides answers through a Gradio chat interface.
